#Changelog

## [0.14.0] - 2024-02-02

- Improved the general UI of the app, with a more modern style.
- Allow to detach UI panels.
- Improved glTF export.
- Improved files opening (add recent file list, remember last opened dir).

## [0.13.0] - 2023-12-27

- Some fixes for glTF export.
- Added shortcuts for Add/Sub/Paint.
- Allow to simplify exported glTF.

Minor update, mostly so that I can try to sign the Mac package, and also
release an AppImage for the linux build.


## [0.12.0] - 2023-04-01

- Added basic support for Minetest file format import.
- Added a new tool to select from a 2d rectangle.
- Fixed issues with high density screens.
- Added some (very basic) support for scripting.

The biggest new feature is probably the scripting support.  For the moment it
is very limited, see the example in data/scripts/test.js.  If you would like to
make your own scripts but some features are missing (and they will), please
open an issue about it.
